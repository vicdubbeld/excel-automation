# Work Automation
<br>
This is an ever-evolving automation project that involves .csv files and TripAdvisor encryption.
<br>
This is what has been accomplished so far:
    1. Certain data is converted to hash and hex.
    2. Date format will remain in "dd mmm, yyyy" format.
<br>
Next things to work on:
    1. Eliminating duplicate email addresses
    2. Creating new file for the output every time program is run
    3. Adapting to various formats of files
